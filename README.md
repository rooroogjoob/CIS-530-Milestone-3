The baseline file should be run with the following command:

python baseline.py eng_mag fr_mag bilingual_dict test_dict output_file

eng_mag and fr_mag are .magnitude files that we created from the .vec files that we wrote about in the last milestone. The bilingual and test dicts are the same as mentioned in the earlier milestone. output_file is just the name of the output_file.

The performance with this baseline was 36.28% accuracy.
